**Summary:**
Today's development efforts focused on enhancing user experience, improving system functionality, and addressing critical bugs. Key areas of work included user interface improvements, media management system enhancements, and the implementation of a two-factor authentication (2FA) system for increased security.

**Key Features/Changes Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced ICC Profile Display:**
   - Improved the user interface for displaying ICC profiles in the hair sample list by adding color swatches and undertone text for a better user experience.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
   - Implemented optional 2FA using PyOTP, enhancing security by allowing users to enable 2FA via QR codes.
   - Added 2FA recovery functionality, enabling users to recover access via email if they lose access to their authenticator app.

**Bug Fixes and Improvements:**

1. **Change Request Logs:**
   - Updated change request logs to use integer primary keys instead of UUIDs for consistency.
   - Enhanced logging system to include user tracking for all operations, improving accountability and traceability.       

2. **Media Association and Display:**
   - Fixed issues with media association persistence and image display by ensuring proper handling of media IDs and URLs.  
   - Improved the upload user experience by providing clear success feedback and maintaining the user on the upload page post-upload.

3. **Technical Improvements:**
   - Addressed access issues by removing ACL parameters and relying on bucket policies for public access in Scaleway storage.
   - Enhanced database schema by removing unnecessary foreign key constraints, allowing for more flexible data management. 

**Technical Details:**

- **Database Migrations:** Several migrations were executed to update the schema, including the removal of foreign key constraints for ICC profiles and the addition of new tables for media management.
- **Scaleway Integration:** Adjustments were made to the Scaleway storage integration to improve file upload reliability and public accessibility.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Various UI components were updated to improve usability, including the addition of new dropdowns and modals for media selection and 2FA setup.

Overall, today's updates significantly enhance the functionality and security of the system, providing a more robust and user-friendly experience. These changes are expected to improve user satisfaction and streamline administrative tasks.
